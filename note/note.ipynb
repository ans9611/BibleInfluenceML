    "# NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is an open-source Python library widely used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides a range of tools and resources for analyzing, preprocessing, and manipulating text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of NLTK:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization:** NLTK offers tokenizers to split text into words or sentences, facilitating text analysis and preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** NLTK includes algorithms and pre-trained models for assigning grammatical labels to words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition:** NLTK provides tools for identifying and extracting named entities (e.g., person names, locations) from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis:** NLTK offers functionality for determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WordNet:** NLTK provides an interface to WordNet, a lexical database that allows access to word definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and word relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stemming and Lemmatization:** NLTK supports techniques for reducing words to their base forms, aiding in text normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Corpora and Datasets:** NLTK includes various datasets, corpora, and language resources, such as text collections and lexical resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning for NLP:** NLTK supports training and applying machine learning models on text data, enabling tasks like classification and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage of NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is widely used in academia and industry for numerous NLP applications, including text classification, information extraction, sentiment analysis, and language modeling. Its extensive documentation and active community make it a powerful tool for working with text data in Python.\n"
